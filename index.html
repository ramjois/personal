         <p> Welcome to my website; although designed in the mid-2022 after getting triply vaccinated against COVID-19, it still looks as if you ended up in a 90s webpage. This is <i>purely intentional</i> and has got <i>nothing</i> to do with the html skills, <small>which is at a hopeless level</small>. If you see any typos or error in grammar, please note they are also intentional.

         <p> I love writing HTML programs; I learned the basics in my pre-university (12th grade or A-levels depending on where you live). I don't really get a lot of free time to write HTML scripts.</p>

          My name is Shriram Sadashivajois. I'm an Experimental Astrophysicist, a Marie-Sklodowska Curie fellow in Physics <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/shriram-sadashivajois(ecc88813-32fd-4889-8b03-9cd48bb1becc).html">at Royal Holloway - University of London</a>. I write under a <i>nom de plume </i>of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=d32ezKgAAAAJ">Shriram Jois</a>. During the PhD days, I was a member of ADMX; now with the DarkSide-20k collaboration. I live in the U.K.
          Before coming to the U.K., I did a PhD in Physics at the University of Florida. I wrote a dissertation titled, "A Search for Relic Axions and Their Frequency Modulation". For a Marie-Sklodowska Curie fellowship, I wrote a proposal to search Solar Axions in the Silicon of the Silicon Photo Multipliers (SiPM) through an Axio-Electric effect.
